<p class="has-text-align-center">By the President of the United States of America<br>&nbsp;<br>A Proclamation<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Since the earliest days of our history, our Nation&#8217;s future has been forged by skilled American hands and proud American hearts.  From the settlers at Jamestown to the titans of industrialization and manufacturing, America has understood that, in order to be a great Nation, we must be a Nation that builds, creates, innovates, and fights for the needs of our own workers, families, and industries first.  This Made in America Week, my Administration recommits to furthering this legacy &#8212; and we pledge to embolden our workers, reenergize our industries, and bring back those beautiful words:  &#8220;Made in the U.S.A.&#8221;<br></p>



<p class="has-text-align-left">Though the United States has long been a hub of manufacturing and an epicenter of ingenuity, over the decades, a globalist ruling class closed our factories, shipped away our jobs, and stripped our families and our communities of their homes, fortunes, and dreams. They hollowed out America as they built up China, and American citizens suffered as a result.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>Every day, my Administration is once again reclaiming American sovereignty by modernizing and improving existing trade agreements, negotiating new deals based on the principles of fairness and reciprocity, and taking strong enforcement actions against trading partners that break the rules.  We are putting our Nation&#8217;s interests first.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>In March, I proudly signed an Executive Order to create the United States Investment Accelerator, establishing an office within the Department of Commerce tasked with facilitating investments higher than $1 billion in America.  I also signed a Presidential Memorandum to bolster foreign investment while defending our national security interests.  To further unleash domestic production, with the enactment of the historic One Big Beautiful Bill earlier this month, we delivered interest deduction for loans on new American-made vehicles, as well as 100 percent expensing for new factories, equipment, and machinery.  These pro-worker, pro-family policies are leveling the playing field for American businesses and boosting production on American shores.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>I have also directed the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on sellers who falsely claim their products are &#8220;Made in the U.S.A.&#8221;  Americans want to support their fellow citizens rather than send their money overseas in exchange for poor-quality goods.  The &#8220;Made in the U.S.A.&#8221; label is not just a slogan, but a sign that a product truly connects us with the ingenuity, quality craftmanship, and livelihood of our Nation.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>As a result of my Administration&#8217;s leadership and America First vision, companies are lining up to do business with the United States.  Already, we have attracted trillions of dollars&#8217; worth of foreign and domestic investments &#8212; and our work is only just beginning.  These historic investments are drastically increasing our domestic manufacturing capabilities, reinvigorating struggling industries, and unleashing a new wave of American innovation.  Thanks to my Administration&#8217;s commonsense policies, for 4 months in a row, job numbers have beat market expectations, with American-born workers accounting for all of the job gains since I took office.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>Together, we are rebuilding our Nation with American heart, hands, and grit.  We are bringing back a culture of boldness and creativity that will empower the next generation of innovators, unleash the full strength of the American spirit, and ensure our economy, our culture, and our way of life remain the envy of the world.  Above all, under my leadership, we are proudly building, inventing, and creating in the United States of America once again.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim this week, July 20 through July 26, 2025, as Made in America Week.  I call upon all Americans to pay special tribute to the builders, the ranchers, the crafters, the entrepreneurs, and all those who work with their hands every day to make America great.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-left"><br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.<br><br>                               DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">By the President of the United States of America</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A Proclamation</p>



<p>This Captive Nations Week, I offer my heartfelt support to every person living under a totalitarian regime and I reaffirm my commitment to advancing a new era of peace where freedom is cherished, sovereignty is respected, and every nation can live without fear of tyranny or oppression.</p>



<p>In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower first proclaimed Captive Nations Week to counter the emerging threat of communism and declare America&#8217;s resolve to defend the fundamental rights of free speech, religious liberty, and self-government.&nbsp; As President, I continue that work today, as far too often, oppressive regimes still silence dissent and persecute their own citizens for practicing their faith.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Religious Liberty Commission, the White House Faith Office, and the Department of State&#8217;s Office of International Religious Freedom are working together to expand and strengthen America&#8217;s efforts to defend religious freedom around the world.&nbsp; In the United States, we will always uphold the simple truth that our rights do not come from Government, but from God in Heaven.&nbsp; We believe that legitimate governments derive their power from the consent of the governed and that freedom of religion forms the foundation of free Government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Guided by these truths, my Administration continues to work for a more stable and peaceful world.&nbsp; We remain fiercely committed to working with our allies and adversaries alike to pursue strong diplomacy, resolve conflicts, and forge lasting peace everywhere.</p>



<p>America stands with all people who resist tyranny, defend their faith, and fight for the God-given rights of every human being.&nbsp; We will continue to lead with strength, speak truth in the face of oppression, and advance the cause of peace, liberty, and human dignity across the globe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Congress, by Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the third week of July of each year as &#8220;Captive Nations Week.&#8221;</p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim July 20 through July 26, 2025, as Captive Nations Week.&nbsp; I call upon all Americans to reaffirm our commitment to supporting those around the world striving for liberty, justice, and the rule of law with appropriate ceremonies and activities.</p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of July, in the year of our Lord two&nbsp;thousand&nbsp;twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United&nbsp;States of&nbsp;America the two&nbsp;hundred and fiftieth.<br><br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span><em>.</em>  College sports are a uniquely American institution that provide life-changing educational and leadership-development opportunities to more than 500,000 student-athletes through almost $4 billion in scholarships each year.  College athletics also provide substantial support to local economies and form an indelible part of family activities, pastimes, and culture in many communities. </p>



<p>While major college football games can draw tens of millions of television viewers and attendees, they feature only a very small sample of the many athletes who benefit from the transformational opportunities that college athletics provide.&nbsp; Sixty-five percent of the 2024 United States Olympic Team members were current or former National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) varsity athletes, and approximately seventy-five percent were collegiate athletes. &nbsp;The 2024 United States Olympic Team earned 126 total medals, leading the overall medal count for the eighth consecutive Summer Olympic Games.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Beyond driving our unrivaled success in international competition, college athletes are more likely to report better outcomes in important respects during college and after graduation.&nbsp; A substantial majority of female executives at the largest American companies participated in sports during adolescence, many at the high school or collegiate level, and examples of business leaders and former Presidents who played college sports are legion. &nbsp;It is no exaggeration to say that America&#8217;s system of collegiate athletics plays an integral role in forging the leaders that drive our Nation&#8217;s success.</p>



<p>Yet the future of college sports is under unprecedented threat.  Waves of recent litigation against collegiate athletics governing rules have eliminated limits on athlete compensation, pay-for-play recruiting inducements, and transfers between universities, unleashing a sea change that threatens the viability of college sports.  While changes providing some increased benefits and flexibility to student-athletes were overdue and should be maintained, the inability to maintain reasonable rules and guardrails is a mortal threat to most college sports.</p>



<p>To illustrate, following a 2021 antitrust ruling from the United States Supreme Court striking down NCAA restrictions, the NCAA changed its rules to permit players to receive compensation for their name, image, and likeness (NIL) from third parties.  But guardrails designed to ensure that these were legitimate, market-value NIL payments for endorsements or similar services, rather than simply pay-for-play inducements, were eliminated through litigation.  Other limits on player transfers among schools were also taken down through litigation. </p>



<p>This has created an out-of-control, rudderless system in which competing university donors engage in bidding wars for the best players, who can change teams each season.&nbsp; Meanwhile, more than 30 States have passed their own NIL laws in a chaotic race to the bottom, sometimes to gain temporary competitive advantages for their major collegiate teams.&nbsp; As a result, players at some universities will receive more than $50 million per year, mostly for the revenue-generating sports like football.&nbsp; Entering the 2024 season, players on the eventual college football national champion team were being paid around $20 million annually.&nbsp; By the 2025 season, football players at one university will reportedly be paid $35-40 million, with revenue-sharing included.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This not only reduces competition and parity by creating an oligarchy of teams that can simply buy the best players &#8212; including the best players from less-wealthy programs at the end of each season &#8212; but the imperative that university donors must devote ever-escalating resources to compete in the revenue-generating sports like football and basketball siphons away the resources necessary to support the panoply of non-revenue sports.&nbsp; Absent guardrails to stop the madness and ensure a reasonable, balanced use of resources across collegiate athletic programs that preserves their educational and developmental benefits, many college sports will soon cease to exist.</p>



<p>A national solution is urgently needed to prevent this situation from deteriorating beyond repair and to protect non-revenue sports, including many women&#8217;s sports, that comprise the backbone of intercollegiate athletics, drive American superiority at the Olympics and other international competitions, and catalyze hundreds of thousands of student-athletes to fuel American success in myriad ways.</p>



<p>Attempting to create some guardrails and shelter from litigation, colleges have adopted a new regime, deciding to pay athletes directly and simultaneously limit the total number of athletes on their campuses.&nbsp; Given that the new roster limits, by exceeding the scholarship limits they replace, will increase the potential number of scholarships available in many sports, this opportunity must be utilized to strengthen and expand non-revenue sports.&nbsp; Simultaneously, the third-party market of pay-for-play inducements must be eliminated before its insatiable demand for resources dries up support for non-revenue sports.&nbsp; Otherwise, a crucial American asset will be lost.</p>



<p>It is the policy of my Administration that all college sports should be preserved and, where possible, expanded.  My Administration will therefore provide the stability, fairness, and balance necessary to protect student-athletes, collegiate athletic scholarships and opportunities, and the special American institution of college sports.  It is common sense that college sports are not, and should not be, professional sports, and my Administration will take action accordingly.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Protecting and Expanding Women&#8217;s and Non-Revenue Sports and Prohibiting Third-Party Pay-for-Play Payments</span>.  (a)  It is the policy of the executive branch that opportunities for scholarships and collegiate athletic competition in women&#8217;s and non-revenue sports must be preserved and, where possible, expanded, including specifically as follows with respect to the 2025-2026 athletic season and future athletic seasons:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collegiate athletic departments with greater than $125,000,000 in revenue during the 2024-2025 athletic season should provide more scholarship opportunities in non-revenue sports than during the 2024-2025 athletic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for non-revenue sports permitted under the applicable collegiate athletic rules;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;college athletic departments with greater than $50,000,000 in revenue during the 2024-2025 athletic season should provide at least as many scholarship opportunities in non-revenue sports as provided during the 2024-2025 athletic season and should provide the maximum number of roster spots for non-revenue sports permitted under the applicable collegiate athletic rules; and</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;college athletic departments with $50,000,000 or less in revenue during the 2024-2025 athletic season or that do not have any revenue-generating sports should not disproportionately reduce scholarship opportunities or roster spots for sports based on the revenue that the sport generates.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (b)&nbsp; It is the policy of the executive branch that any revenue-sharing permitted between universities and collegiate athletes should be designed and implemented in a manner that preserves or expands scholarships and collegiate athletic opportunities in women&#8217;s and non-revenue sports.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; To preserve the critical educational and developmental benefits of collegiate athletics for our Nation, it is the policy of the executive branch that third-party, pay-for-play payments to collegiate athletes are improper and should not be permitted by universities.&nbsp; This policy does not apply to compensation provided to an athlete for the fair market value that the athlete provides to a third party, such as for a brand endorsement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(d)&nbsp; Within 30 days of the date of this order, the Secretary of Education, in consultation with the Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Education, and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, shall develop a plan to advance the policies set forth in subsections (a)-(c) of this section through all available and appropriate regulatory, enforcement, and litigation mechanisms, including Federal funding decisions, enforcement of Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972, prohibiting unconstitutional actions by States to regulate interstate commerce, and enforcement of other constitutional and statutory protections, and by working with the Congress and State governments, as appropriate.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Student-Athlete Status</span>.  The Secretary of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board shall determine and implement the appropriate measures with respect to clarifying the status of collegiate athletes, including through guidance, rules, or other appropriate actions, that will maximize the educational benefits and opportunities provided by higher education institutions through athletics.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Legal Protections for College Athletics from Lawsuits</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall work to stabilize and preserve college athletics through litigation, guidelines, policies, or other actions, as appropriate, by protecting the rights and interests of student-athletes and the long-term availability of collegiate athletic scholarships and opportunities when such elements are unreasonably challenged under antitrust or other legal theories.</p>



<p>(b)  Within 60 days of the date of this order, to advance the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General and the Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission shall:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;review, and as necessary revise, litigation positions, guidelines, policies, or other actions; and</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;develop a plan to implement appropriate future litigation positions, guidelines, policies, or other actions.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Protecting Development of the United States Olympic Team</span>.  The Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and the Director of the White House Office of Public Liaison shall consult the United States Olympic and Paralympic Committee and other appropriate organizations of American athletes about safeguarding the integral role and competitive advantage that American collegiate athletics provide in developing athletes to represent our Nation in international athletic competitions.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (d)&nbsp; The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Education.</p>

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose and Policy</span>.  Endemic vagrancy, disorderly behavior, sudden confrontations, and violent attacks have made our cities unsafe.  The number of individuals living on the streets in the United States on a single night during the last year of the previous administration &#8212; 274,224 &#8212; was the highest ever recorded.  The overwhelming majority of these individuals are addicted to drugs, have a mental health condition, or both.  Nearly two-thirds of homeless individuals report having regularly used hard drugs like methamphetamines, cocaine, or opioids in their lifetimes.  An equally large share of homeless individuals reported suffering from mental health conditions.  The Federal Government and the States have spent tens of billions of dollars on failed programs that address homelessness but not its root causes, leaving other citizens vulnerable to public safety threats.</p>



<p>Shifting homeless individuals into long-term institutional settings for humane treatment through the appropriate use of civil commitment will restore public order.&nbsp; Surrendering our cities and citizens to disorder and fear is neither compassionate to the homeless nor other citizens.&nbsp; My Administration will take a new approach focused on protecting public safety.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Restoring Civil Commitment</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall take appropriate action to:</p>



<p>(i)   seek, in appropriate cases, the reversal of Federal or State judicial precedents and the termination of consent decrees that impede the United States&#8217; policy of encouraging civil commitment of individuals with mental illness who pose risks to themselves or the public or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves in appropriate facilities for appropriate periods of time; and</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;provide assistance to State and local governments, through technical guidance, grants, or other legally available means, for the identification, adoption, and implementation of maximally flexible civil commitment, institutional treatment, and &#8220;step-down&#8221; treatment standards that allow for the appropriate commitment and treatment of individuals with mental illness who pose a danger to others or are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Fighting Vagrancy on America&#8217;s Streets</span>.  (a)  The Attorney General, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Secretary of Transportation shall take immediate steps to assess their discretionary grant programs and determine whether priority for those grants may be given to grantees in States and municipalities that actively meet the below criteria, to the maximum extent permitted by law:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on open illicit drug use;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban camping and loitering;</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;enforce prohibitions on urban squatting;</p>



<p>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enforce, and where necessary, adopt, standards that address individuals who are a danger to themselves or others and suffer from serious mental illness or substance use disorder, or who are living on the streets and cannot care for themselves, through assisted outpatient treatment or by moving them into treatment centers or other appropriate facilities via civil commitment or other available means, to the maximum extent permitted by law; or</p>



<p>(v)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;substantially implement and comply with, to the extent required, the registration and notification obligations of the Sex Offender Registry and Notification Act, particularly in the case of registered sex offenders with no fixed address, including by adequately mapping and checking the location of homeless sex offenders.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that homeless individuals arrested for Federal crimes are evaluated, consistent with 18 U.S.C. 4248, to determine whether they are sexually dangerous persons and certified accordingly for civil commitment;</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; &nbsp;take all necessary steps to ensure the availability of funds under the Emergency Federal Law Enforcement Assistance program to support, as consistent with 34 U.S.C. 50101 <em>et seq</em>., encampment removal efforts in areas for which public safety is at risk and State and local resources are inadequate;</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;assess Federal resources to determine whether they may be directed toward ensuring, to the extent permitted by law, that detainees with serious mental illness are not released into the public because of a lack of forensic bed capacity at appropriate local, State, and Federal jails or hospitals; and</p>



<p>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;enhance requirements that prisons and residential reentry centers that are under the authority of the Attorney General or receive funding from the Attorney General require in-custody housing release plans and, to the maximum extent practicable, require individuals to comply.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Redirecting Federal Resources Toward Effective Methods of Addressing Homelessness</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall take appropriate action to:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;ensure that discretionary grants issued by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration for substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery fund evidence-based programs and do not fund programs that fail to achieve adequate outcomes, including so-called &#8220;harm reduction&#8221; or &#8220;safe consumption&#8221; efforts that only facilitate illegal drug use and its attendant harm;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;provide technical assistance to assisted outpatient treatment programs for individuals with serious mental illness or addiction during and after the civil commitment process focused on shifting such individuals off of the streets and public programs and into private housing and support networks; and</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;ensure that Federal funds for Federally Qualified Health Centers and Certified Community Behavioral Health Clinics reduce rather than promote homelessness by supporting, to the maximum extent permitted by law, comprehensive services for individuals with serious mental illness and substance use disorder, including crisis intervention services.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;The Attorney General shall prioritize available funding to support the expansion of drug courts and mental health courts for individuals for which such diversion serves public safety.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Increasing Accountability and Safety in America&#8217;s Homelessness Programs</span>.  (a)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate actions to increase accountability in their provision of, and grants awarded for, homelessness assistance and transitional living programs.  These actions shall include, to the extent permitted by law, ending support for &#8220;housing first&#8221; policies that deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency; increasing competition among grantees through broadening the applicant pool; and holding grantees to higher standards of effectiveness in reducing homelessness and increasing public safety.  </p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, as appropriate, take steps to require recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance to increase requirements that persons participating in the recipients&#8217; programs who suffer from substance use disorder or serious mental illness use substance abuse treatment or mental health services as a condition of participation.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;With respect to recipients of Federal housing and homelessness assistance that operate drug injection sites or &#8220;safe consumption sites,&#8221; knowingly distribute drug paraphernalia, or permit the use or distribution of illicit drugs on property under their control:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; the Attorney General shall review whether such recipients are in violation of Federal law, including 21 U.S.C. 856, and bring civil or criminal actions in appropriate cases; and</p>



<p>(ii)&nbsp; the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in coordination with the Attorney General, shall review whether such recipients are in violation of the terms of the programs pursuant to which they receive Federal housing and homelessness assistance and freeze their assistance as appropriate.</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall take appropriate measures and revise regulations as necessary to allow, where permissible under applicable law, federally funded programs to exclusively house women and children and to stop sex offenders who receive homelessness assistance through such programs from being housed with unrelated children.&nbsp;</p>



<p>(e) &nbsp;The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with the Attorney General and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall, as appropriate and to the extent permitted by law:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;allow or require the recipients of Federal funding for homelessness assistance to collect health-related information that the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development identifies as necessary to the effective and efficient operation of the funding program from all persons to whom such assistance is provided; and</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;require those funding recipients to share such data with law enforcement authorities in circumstances permitted by law and to use the collected health data to provide appropriate medical care to individuals with mental health diagnoses or to connect individuals to public health resources.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c)&nbsp; This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section </span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Policy and Purpose</span>.  My Administration has inaugurated a golden age for American manufacturing and technological dominance.  We will pursue bold, large-scale industrial plans to vault the United States further into the lead on critical manufacturing processes and technologies that are essential to national security, economic prosperity, and scientific leadership.  These plans include artificial intelligence (AI) data centers and infrastructure that powers them, including high‑voltage transmission lines and other equipment.  It will be a priority of my Administration to facilitate the rapid and efficient buildout of this infrastructure by easing Federal regulatory burdens. </p>



<p>In addition, my Administration will utilize federally owned land and resources for the expeditious and orderly development of data centers.&nbsp; This usage will be done in a manner consistent with the land&#8217;s intended purpose &#8212; to be used in service of the prosperity and security of the American people.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For purposes of this order:</p>



<p>(a) &nbsp;&#8220;Data Center Project&#8221; means a facility that requires greater than 100 megawatts (MW) of new load dedicated to AI inference, training, simulation, or synthetic data generation.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;&#8220;Covered Components&#8221; means materials, products, and infrastructure that are required to build Data Center Projects or otherwise upon which Data Center Projects depend, including:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;energy infrastructure, such as transmission lines, natural gas pipelines or laterals, substations, switchyards, transformers, switchgear, and system protective facilities;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;natural gas turbines, coal power equipment, nuclear power equipment, geothermal power equipment, and any other dispatchable baseload energy sources, including electrical infrastructure (including backup power supply) constructed or otherwise used principally to serve a Data Center Project;</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;semiconductors and semiconductor materials, such as wafers, dies, and packaged integrated circuits;</p>



<p>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;networking equipment, such as switches and routers; and</p>



<p>(v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;data storage, such as hardware storage systems, software for data management and protection, and integrated services that work with public cloud providers.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;&#8220;Covered Component Project&#8221; means infrastructure comprising Covered Components, or a facility with the primary purposes of manufacturing or otherwise producing Covered Components.</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;&#8220;Qualifying Project&#8221; means:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project for which the Project Sponsor has committed at least $500 million in capital expenditures as determined by the Secretary of Commerce;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project involving an incremental electric load addition of greater than 100 MW;</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project that protects national security; or</p>



<p>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project that has otherwise been designated by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Energy as a &#8220;Qualifying Project&#8221;.</p>



<p>(e) &nbsp;&#8220;Project Sponsor&#8221; means the lead sponsor providing financial and other support for a Data Center Project or Covered Component Project, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Energy, as appropriate.</p>



<p>(f) &nbsp;&#8220;Superfund Site&#8221; means any site where action is being taken pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 9604, 9606, or 9620.</p>



<p>(g) &nbsp;&#8220;Brownfield Site&#8221; means a site as defined in 42 U.S.C. 9601(39).</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Encouraging Qualifying Projects</span>.  The Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and other relevant executive departments and agencies (agencies), shall launch an initiative to provide financial support for Qualifying Projects, which could include loans and loan guarantees, grants, tax incentives, and offtake agreements.  All relevant agencies shall identify and submit to the Director of OSTP any such relevant existing financial support that can be used to assist Qualifying Projects, consistent with the protection of national security.</p>

(a)  Within 10 days of the date of this order, each relevant agency shall identify to the Council on Environmental Quality any categorical exclusions already established or adopted by such agency pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), reliance on and adoption of which by agencies (pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4336 and 4336c) could facilitate the construction of Qualifying Projects.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;The Council on Environmental Quality shall coordinate with relevant agencies on the establishment of new categorical exclusions to cover actions related to Qualifying Projects that normally do not have a significant effect on the human environment.&nbsp; Agencies shall, for purposes of establishing these categorical exclusions, rely on any sufficient basis to do so as each such agency determines.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;Consistent with 42 U.S.C. 4336e(10)(B)(iii), loans, loan guarantees, grants, tax incentives, or other forms of Federal financial assistance for which an agency lacks substantial project-specific control and responsibility over the subsequent use of such financial assistance shall not be considered a &#8220;major Federal action&#8221; under NEPA. &nbsp;For purposes of this order, Federal financial assistance representing less than 50 percent of total project costs shall be presumed not to constitute substantial Federal control and responsibility.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">6</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Efficiency and Transparency Through FAST‑41</span>.  (a)  The Executive Director (Executive Director) of the Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council (FPISC) may, within 30  days of the date that a project is identified to FPISC by a relevant agency, designate a Qualifying Project as a transparency project pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 4370m-2(b)(2)(A)(iii) and section 41003 of the Fixing America&#8217;s Surface Transportation Act (Public Law 114-94, 129 Stat. 1312, 1747) (FAST-41).

(a)  The Department of the Interior and the Department of Energy shall, after consultation with industry and further in consultation with the Department of Commerce as to the Project Sponsors to which relevant authorizations shall be granted, offer appropriate authorizations for sites identified by the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of Energy, as applicable and appropriate for the relevant uses, consistent with 42 U.S.C. 2201, 42 U.S.C. 7256, 43 U.S.C. 1701 <em>et seq</em>., and all other applicable law.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;The Secretary of Defense shall, pursuant to 10&nbsp;U.S.C.&nbsp;2667 or other applicable law and as and when the Secretary of Defense deems it necessary or desirable, identify suitable sites on military installations for Covered Component infrastructure uses and competitively lease available lands for Qualifying Projects to support the Department of Defense&#8217;s energy, workforce, and mission needs, subject to security and force protection considerations.</p>

<p>By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered:</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Section</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">1</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Purpose</span>.  Artificial intelligence (AI) will play a critical role in how Americans of all ages learn new skills, consume information, and navigate their daily lives.  Americans will require reliable outputs from AI, but when ideological biases or social agendas are built into AI models, they can distort the quality and accuracy of the output. </p>



<p>One of the most pervasive and destructive of these ideologies is so-called &#8220;diversity, equity, and inclusion&#8221; (DEI).&nbsp; In the AI context, DEI includes the suppression or distortion of factual information about race or sex; manipulation of racial or sexual representation in model outputs; incorporation of concepts like critical race theory, transgenderism, unconscious bias, intersectionality, and systemic racism; and discrimination on the basis of race or sex.&nbsp; DEI displaces the commitment to truth in favor of preferred outcomes and, as recent history illustrates, poses an existential threat to reliable AI.</p>



<p>For example, one major AI model changed the race or sex of historical figures &#8212; including the Pope, the Founding Fathers, and Vikings &#8212; when prompted for images because it was trained to prioritize DEI requirements at the cost of accuracy.&nbsp; Another AI model refused to produce images celebrating the achievements of white people, even while complying with the same request for people of other races.&nbsp; In yet another case, an AI model asserted that a user should not &#8220;misgender&#8221; another person even if necessary to stop a nuclear apocalypse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the Federal Government should be hesitant to regulate the functionality of AI models in the private marketplace, in the context of Federal procurement, it has the obligation not to procure models that sacrifice truthfulness and accuracy to ideological agendas.&nbsp; Building on Executive Order 13960 of December 3, 2020 (Promoting the Use of Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence in the Federal Government), this order helps fulfill that obligation in the context of large language models.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">2</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Definitions</span>.  For purposes of this order:</p>



<p>(a)&nbsp; The term &#8220;agency&#8221; means an executive department, a military department, or any independent establishment within the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 101, 102, and 104(1), respectively, and any wholly owned Government corporation within the meaning of 31 U.S.C. 9101.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;The term &#8220;agency head&#8221; means the highest-ranking</p>



<p>official or officials of an agency, such as the Secretary, Administrator, Chairman, Director, Commissioners, or Board of Directors.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;The term &#8220;LLM&#8221; means a large language model, which is a generative AI model trained on vast, diverse datasets that enable the model to generate natural-language responses to user prompts.</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;The term &#8220;national security system&#8221; has the same meaning as in 44 U.S.C. 3552(b)(6).</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">3</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Unbiased AI Principles</span>.  It is the policy of the United States to promote the innovation and use of trustworthy AI.  To advance that policy, agency heads shall, consistent with applicable law and in consideration of guidance issued pursuant to section 4 of this order, procure only those LLMs developed in accordance with the following two principles (Unbiased AI Principles): </p>



<p>(a)  Truth-seeking.  LLMs shall be truthful in responding to user prompts seeking factual information or analysis.  LLMs shall prioritize historical accuracy, scientific inquiry, and objectivity, and shall acknowledge uncertainty where reliable information is incomplete or contradictory. </p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; Ideological Neutrality.&nbsp; LLMs shall be neutral, nonpartisan tools that do not manipulate responses in favor of ideological dogmas such as DEI.&nbsp; Developers shall not intentionally encode partisan or ideological judgments into an LLM&#8217;s outputs unless those judgments are prompted by or otherwise readily accessible to the end user.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">4</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">Implementation</span>.  (a)  Within 120 days of the date of this order, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), in consultation with the Administrator for Federal Procurement Policy, the Administrator of General Services, and the Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy, shall issue guidance to agencies to implement section 3 of this order.  That guidance shall:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;account for technical limitations in complying with this order;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;permit vendors to comply with the requirement in the second Unbiased AI Principle to be transparent about ideological judgments through disclosure of the LLM&#8217;s system prompt, specifications, evaluations, or other relevant documentation, and avoid requiring disclosure of specific model weights or other sensitive technical data where practicable;</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;avoid over-prescription and afford latitude for vendors to comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and take different approaches to innovation;</p>



<p>(iv) &nbsp;&nbsp;specify factors for agency heads to consider in determining whether to apply the Unbiased AI Principles to LLMs developed by the agencies and to AI models other than LLMs; and</p>



<p>(v) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make exceptions as appropriate for the use of LLMs in national security systems.</p>



<p>(b)&nbsp; Each agency head shall, to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law:</p>



<p>(i) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;include in each Federal contract for an LLM entered into following the date of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section terms requiring that the procured LLM comply with the Unbiased AI Principles and providing that decommissioning costs shall be charged to the vendor in the event of termination by the agency for the vendor&#8217;s noncompliance with the contract following a reasonable period to cure;</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;&nbsp;to the extent practicable and consistent with contract terms, revise existing contracts for LLMs to include the terms specified in subsection (b)(i) of this section; and</p>



<p>(iii) &nbsp;within 90 days of the OMB guidance issued under subsection (a) of this section, adopt procedures to ensure that LLMs procured by the agency comply with the Unbiased AI Principles.</p>



<p><span style="text-decoration: underline">Sec</span>. <span style="text-decoration: underline">5</span>.  <span style="text-decoration: underline">General Provisions</span>.  (a)  Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>



<p>(i)&nbsp; &nbsp;the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or</p>



<p>(ii) &nbsp;the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>



<p>(b) &nbsp;This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>



<p>(c) &nbsp;This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>



<p>(d) &nbsp;The costs for publication of this order shall be borne by the General Services Administration.</p>



<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">By the President of the United States of America</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A Proclamation</p>



<p>1.  The use of ethylene oxide is critical for the sterilization of medical equipment, which protects patients against infection and the transmission of disease.  The continued utilization of ethylene oxide by commercial sterilization facilities is essential to ensuring that our Nation provides its sick and injured with the best outcomes possible &#8212; an objective that is at the forefront of the Federal Government&#8217;s responsibility to the American people.  <br>2.  On April 5, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412, titled <em>National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:  Ethylene Oxide Emissions Standards for Sterilization Facilities Residual Risk and Technology Review</em>, 89 FR 24090 (EtO Rule).  The EtO Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on commercial sterilization facilities. <br>3.  The EtO Rule places severe burdens on commercial sterilization facilities.  About 50 percent of all sterile medical devices in the United States are sterilized with ethylene oxide, and sterilization with ethylene oxide may be the only method of sterilizing many medical devices without damaging them.  By requiring compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not exist in a commercially viable form, the EtO Rule risks making critical sterile medical devices unavailable to care for patients in our civilian and military medical systems.  The current compliance timeline as set forth at 89 FR 24101-24103 of the EtO Rule will likely force existing sterilization facilities to close down, seriously disrupting the supply of medical equipment.  Our Nation would be unable to adequately supply the sterilized medical equipment that medical personnel need to safely treat their patients in hospitals, operating rooms, and other medical facilities.  In short, the current compliance timeline would undermine our national security.<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the EtO Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the EtO Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the EtO Rule&#8217;s relevant compliance dates (Exemption).  This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the EtO Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline.  The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will remain subject to the emissions and compliance obligations in effect prior to the issuance of the EtO Rule.  In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:</p>



<p>The technology to implement the EtO Rule is not available.  Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the EtO Rule by the compliance dates set forth in the EtO Rule.</p>



<p>It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.</p>



<ol class="wp-block-list"></ol>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.<br><br><br><br>                               DONALD J. TRUMP</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">By the President of the United States of America</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A Proclamation</p>



<p>1.  Coal-fired electricity generation is essential to ensuring that our Nation&#8217;s grid is reliable and that electricity is affordable to the American people, and to promoting our Nation&#8217;s energy security.  The Federal Government plays a pivotal role in ensuring that the Nation&#8217;s power supply remains secure and reliable.  Forcing energy producers to comply with unattainable emissions controls jeopardizes this mission.<br>2.  On May 7, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule, pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412, titled <em>National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants:  Coal- and Oil-Fired Electric Utility Steam Generating Units Review of the Residual Risk and Technology Review</em>, 89 FR 38508 (Rule), which amended the preexisting Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS) rule to make it more stringent.  The Rule&#8217;s effective date was July 8, 2024.  <em>Id.</em>  Its compliance date is July 8, 2027, 3 years after its effective date.  <em>See </em>89 FR 38519.<br>3.  The Rule places severe burdens on coal-fired power plants and, through its indirect effects, on the viability of our Nation&#8217;s coal sector.  Specifically, the Rule requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form.  The current compliance timeline of the Rule therefore raises the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects.  This in turn would undermine our national security, as these effects would leave America vulnerable to electricity demand shortages, increased dependence on foreign energy sources, and potential disruptions of our electricity and energy supplies, particularly in times of crisis.<br>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with the Rule for a period of 2 years beyond the Rule&#8217;s compliance date &#8212; <em>i.e.</em>, for the period beginning July 8, 2027, and concluding July 8, 2029 (Exemption).  The effect of this Exemption is that, during this 2-year period, these stationary sources are subject to the compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the MATS as the MATS existed prior to the Rule.  In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:<br>a.  The technology to implement the Rule is not available.  Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the Rule by its compliance date of July 8, 2027.<br>b.  It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.<br>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this<br>seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth.</p>

<p class="has-text-align-center">By the President of the United States of America</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">A Proclamation</p>



<p>1. The United States relies on a strong chemical manufacturing sector to support industries like energy, national defense, agriculture, and health care. These facilities produce essential inputs for critical infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, medical sterilization, semiconductors, and national defense systems. Maintaining a robust domestic chemical industry is vital to safeguarding the supply chains that underpin our economy and to reducing the Nation&#8217;s dependence on foreign control over materials critical to national resilience. As adversaries expand influence over key inputs, continued domestic production is essential not only to economic resilience but also to military readiness, public health, and national preparedness.</p>



<p>2. On May 16, 2024, the Environmental Protection Agency published a final rule titled <em>New Source Performance Standards for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants for the Synthetic Organic Chemical Manufacturing Industry and Group I &amp; II Polymers and Resins Industry, 89 FR 42932 </em>(HON Rule). The HON Rule imposes new emissions-control requirements on certain chemical manufacturing facilities, some of which were promulgated pursuant to section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412.</p>



<p>3. The HON Rule imposes substantial burdens on chemical manufacturers already operating under stringent regulations. Many of the testing and monitoring requirements outlined in the HON Rule rely on technologies that are not practically available, not demonstrated at the necessary scale, or cannot be implemented safely or consistently under real-world conditions. For many facilities, the timeline for compliance as set forth at 89 FR 42953-42955 would require shutdowns or massive capital investments before any proven pathway to compliance exists. The HON Rule imposes requirements that assume uniform technological availability across facilities, despite significant variation in site conditions, permitting realities, and equipment configurations. A disruption of this capacity would weaken key supply chains, increase dependence on foreign producers, and impair our ability to respond effectively in a time of crisis. These consequences would ripple across sectors vital to America&#8217;s growing industrial strength and emergency readiness.<br></p>



<p>NOW, THEREFORE, I, DONALD J. TRUMP, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 112(i)(4) of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412(i)(4), do hereby proclaim that certain stationary sources subject to the HON Rule, as identified in Annex I of this proclamation, are exempt from compliance with those aspects of the HON Rule that were promulgated under section 112 of the Clean Air Act, 42 U.S.C. 7412 for a period of 2 years beyond the HON Rule&#8217;s relevant compliance dates (Exemption). This Exemption applies to all compliance deadlines established under the HON Rule applicable to the stationary sources listed in Annex I, with each such deadline extended by 2 years from the date originally required for such deadline. The effect of this Exemption is that, during each such 2-year period, these stationary sources will be subject to the emissions and compliance obligations that they are currently subject to under the applicable standard as that standard existed prior to the HON Rule. In support of this Exemption, I hereby make the following determinations:<br></p>



<p>a. The technology to implement the HON Rule is not available. Such technology does not exist in a commercially viable form sufficient to allow implementation of and compliance with the HON Rule by the compliance dates in the HON Rule.<br></p>



<p>b. It is in the national security interests of the United States to issue this Exemption for the reasons stated in paragraphs 1 and 3 of this proclamation.<br></p>



<p>IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord two thousand twenty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fiftieth. </p>
